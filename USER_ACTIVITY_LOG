1. Create local table


   create table USER_ACTIVITY_LOG as ( select * from (SELECT 
        TRUNC(view_timestamp) AS view_date,APPLICATION_SCHEMA_OWNER,
        TO_CHAR(view_timestamp, 'HH24') AS view_hour,
      
        
        
        upper(apex_user) USER_NAME ,  count(*) events
      
    FROM 
        apex_workspace_activity_log
        where APPLICATION_SCHEMA_OWNER=USER
        group by upper(apex_user),TRUNC(view_timestamp), TO_CHAR(view_timestamp, 'HH24'),APPLICATION_SCHEMA_OWNER));

2.Create Job
BEGIN
   DBMS_SCHEDULER.create_job(
      job_name        => 'daily_user_activity_log_5am_edt_job',
      job_type        => 'PLSQL_BLOCK',
      job_action      => 'BEGIN
                            -- Delete records for the previous day
                            DELETE FROM user_activity_log
                            WHERE TRUNC(view_date) = TRUNC(SYSDATE - 1);

                            -- Insert summarized data for the previous day
                            INSERT INTO user_activity_log (view_date, APPLICATION_SCHEMA_OWNER, view_hour, USER_NAME, events)
                            SELECT 
                                TRUNC(view_timestamp) AS view_date,
                                APPLICATION_SCHEMA_OWNER,
                                TO_CHAR(view_timestamp, ''HH24'') AS view_hour,
                                UPPER(apex_user) AS USER_NAME,
                                COUNT(*) AS events
                            FROM 
                                apex_workspace_activity_log
                            WHERE 
                                APPLICATION_SCHEMA_OWNER = USER 
                                AND TRUNC(view_timestamp) = TRUNC(SYSDATE - 1)
                            GROUP BY 
                                TRUNC(view_timestamp), APPLICATION_SCHEMA_OWNER, TO_CHAR(view_timestamp, ''HH24''), UPPER(apex_user);

                            DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(''Daily job completed at 5 AM EDT'');
                          END;',
      start_date      => CAST(trunc(sysdate, 'YEAR')+2/24 AS TIMESTAMP) at time zone 'America/New_York',
      repeat_interval => 'FREQ=DAILY; BYHOUR=5; BYMINUTE=0; BYSECOND=0',
  
      enabled         => TRUE,
      comments        => 'A daily job to clean and summarize user activity logs at 5 AM EDT'
   );
END;
